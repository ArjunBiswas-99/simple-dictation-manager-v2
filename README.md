## Architecture

The application follows **SOLID principles** and **modular design**:

- **SpeechRecognition** - Handles Web Speech API
- **TextEditor** - Manages text content and formatting
- **LanguageManager** - Handles language state
- **CommandProcessor** - Processes voice commands
- **UIController** - Manages UI updates
- **DictationApp** - Coordinates all modules

Each module has a single responsibility and is independently testable.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Data Persistence**: Text is NOT saved automatically. Copy your text before closing the browser.

⚠️ **Internet Required**: Speech recognition requires active internet connection.

⚠️ **Privacy**: Speech is processed by browser's Web Speech API (Google's service).

## Customization

### Adding Custom Voice Commands

Edit `js/commandProcessor.js` and add to the `commands` object:

```javascript
punctuation: {
    'your command': 'output',
}
```

### Adding More Languages

Edit `js/languageManager.js` and add to the `languages` object:

```javascript
'fr-FR': {
    code: 'fr-FR',
    name: 'French',
    nativeName: 'Français',
    direction: 'ltr'
}
```

Then update the dropdown in `index.html`.
